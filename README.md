## Tools in C++

An array of tools that I am making as a part of learning various game engine architectures.

### Includes

- **StackAllocator**
  A Stack based memory allocator.


### Running the Code

I use [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp) to test and C++14 to compile them. They should work with C++11 as far as I know.
