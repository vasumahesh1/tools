## Tools in C++

An array of tools that I am making as a part of learning various game engine architectures.

### Includes

- **StackAllocator**
  A Stack based memory allocator.



### Running the Code

I use [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) to test the code and C++14 to compile them. To run this on your system, you need CMake.

Execute these to run tests:
```bash
cd build
cmake .. && make
ctest
```
